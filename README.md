# Infrastructure-Project
This work was created for the purpose of our "Infrastructure and Transportation Engineering" project at Tunisia Polytechnic School. It contains several plots and heatmaps created to visualize the traffic in Chicago. As well as Deep Learning models that we created in order to model and forecast average speed in different regions of the city.

* Animations can be found in **animations.md**
* There are 4 model notebooks. Each one is called infrastructure project model  
* There are 2 notebooks where we plotted data and visualized heatmaps: 'map_visualization_notebook' and 'plots'
