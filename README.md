# Infrastructure-Project
This work was created for the purpose of our "Infrastructure and Transportation Engineering" project at Tunisia Polytechnic School. It contains several plots and heatmaps created to visualize the traffic in Chicago. As well as Deep Learning models that we created in order to model and forecast average speed in different regions of the city.

* Animations can be found in **animations.md**
* in the notebooks folder you will find the 4 model notebooks.
* in the animation folder you will find  2 notebooks where we plotted data and visualized heatmaps: 'map_visualization_notebook' and 'plots'
